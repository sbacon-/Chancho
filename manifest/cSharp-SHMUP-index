      <h2>SHMUP</h2>
      <p>
        Had a great weekend making this, wanted to complete a project on a LD Jam Timeline in the Unity Engine, this is about 2 days or work.
        Very happy with the results, collision is terrible and I had meant to implement some sort of boost system, but I decided to focus more on
        visuals and overall feel of the game.<br>

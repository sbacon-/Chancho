        This is a tool I created to turn an old phone into a drawing tablet.<br>
        The current functionality only allows for stylus input<br>
        Haven't made an app in a while so it's pretty bare bones<br>
        Currently Requires the Android Debug Bridge and you need to alter<br>
        the PC client source code to the proper directory<br>

        I bought a Wacom tablet... It was like 20 USD

        This is a simple utility to emulate the mouse as being pressed very rapidly (33 C/s)<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Update 12/11/19</strong><br>
        Updated for ease of use, the clicker will now ask for a number of clicks.
        The Clicker will run where the ok key is clicked. Or wherever the mouse is when the
        dialog is closed.<br>

        Enjoy!

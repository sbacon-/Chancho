<h3>Updates</h3>
<pre>
Welcome to the new & improved Chancho.dev 3.0
Complete with a fresh coat of paint!!

I've setup a server to host the site locally to allow for POST requests.
This will allow me to create leader boards, and other PHP functionality.
Excited to add new features and pages.

I've also created a new C++ program that writes the HTML for me.
Making it far easier to frequently add new content. So stay tuned.
Check it out over on <a href="https://github.com/sbacon-/chancho"> gitHub </a>.
On a semi-related note, the minecraft server is back: <em>mc.chancho.dev</em>

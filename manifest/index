<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>
Welcome to the new & improved Chancho.dev 3.0<br>
Complete with a fresh coat of paint!!<br>
<br>
I've setup a server to host the site locally to allow for POST requests.<br>
This will allow me to create leader boards, and other PHP functionality.<br>
Excited to add new features and pages<br>
<br>
I've also created a new C++ program that writes the HTML for me.<br>
Making it far easier to frequently add new content. So stay tuned.<br>
Check it out over on <a href="https://github.com/sbacon-/chancho"> gitHub </a>.<br>
On a semi-related note, the minecraft server is back: <em>mc.chancho.dev</em><br>

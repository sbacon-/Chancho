<li>Fullscreen mode will make the camera more difficult to control. Still playable, but not recommended.</li>

<h3>Hospitality for the recently departed</h3>
Decided to try my hand at a tower building sim.
I've been considering making this type of game for a while.
Luckily, I was able to shoehorn the genre with the LD<i>L</i> theme.
<br><br>
<a href = "/res/img/ld50_prep.png"><img src="/res/img/ld50_prep.png" alt="Hastily scribbled Game Ideas from the Final Round"><br></a>

<h4> Taking Lessons From Past Mistakes </h4>
I didn't prepare as much as I typically do for the Compo. (Only one practice project the week before <a href="/cSharp/Wordle/index.html"> Wordle Clone </a>).
Before LD49, I spent weeks trying to learn C# best practices, Blender modeling techniques, and learning a new MIDI/Audio Sequencer (muse4).
By the time the compo started I was unable to focus on what was really important:
<br><br>

<h4>Making the Project 'I' Wanted to Make</h4>
<a href = "/res/img/ld50_wb.png"><img src="/res/img/ld50_wb.png" alt="Whiteboard with themes: Tax Evasion, Sinking Ship, etc."></a><br>
Taking a more relaxed aproach this time, I made my list once the final round of voting started.
Once the theme was announced - I wrote more ideas on the whiteboard to make a decision.
The theme was so broad this time that I figured any game with a fail state could be a candidate.
So I went with an idea that I've had since my career change into the hospitality industry.
<br><br>

<a href="/res/img/ld50_prog1.gif"><img src="/res/img/ld50_prog1.gif" alt="Prototype with building and Guest AI"><br></a>
Armed with enough chips, candy, and caffeine to feed a small village, I got to work;
and after a few hours I had the basic structure finished.
The guests looked a bit like a skeletons already, so with some slight adjustments a tone was established.
<br><br>

<h4>Lessons Learned</h4><br>
<a href="/res/img/ld50_notes.png"><img src="/res/img/ld50_notes.png"><br></a>
One of the biggest things that helped was PLAY-TESTING. In previous years, I've received tons of feedback
on the controls in the game. I enlisted the help of my sister to try out the game before publishing.
There were a ton of things I didn't consider: <br>
<i>What will they do if they skip the control menu?<br>
What if they are playing with only a mouse?<br>
Why does nothing happen when you click the around the lobby (*wink)?<br> </i>
These questions never would have crossed my mind otherwise. Thanks Kass!
<br><br>

Overall, very happy with how this one turned out. Hope you enjoyed as much as I have, look out for a mobile release (coming soon... maybe)<br>
See y'all in October
